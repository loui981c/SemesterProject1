Dear Ms. Quraishi,
I am very excited about the possibility of joining the Software Engineering Unit of General Motors in the position. In addition to my experience gained with IBM, I am graduating with an Honours Bachelor of Applied Science degree from York University. My solid knowledge of computer software design and project development has given me the foundation to succeed in the software engineering industry. Skills in creating Use Cases and project planning have benefited both clients and past employers and enhanced my ability to provide creative thinking and problem solving. During my program I became interested in Global Positioning Systems and real time kinematic applications. Through my interest in the automotive industry I have kept abreast of current product developments and trends and am extremely excited about the ongoing development of OnStar. I look forward to meeting with you and other members of the Software Engineering Unit to further discuss my suitability for this position. I can be contacted at phone: 75463211 or  mail: Strongboi@pepsi.com.
Sincerely,
David Strong
