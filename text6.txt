Dear Mr. Jones
As a long time admirer of [Company Name]'s focus on improving user experience, I'm excited to apply for your newly announced Java Developer position. I believe that my 7+ years of experience, BS in computer science, and unwavering commitment to building user-centric
applications make me a great addition to your team. In my current role at IT America, I've shown a knack for leveraging Java, J2EE, and Spring to craft user-friendly web applications. I've also demonstrated my ability to drastically improve existing apps by identifying bugs, streamlining code, and adding functionalities. During my career, I've consistently delivered results that exceeded clients' expectations,
proven by the following:
Improving the runtime of an application for IT America's top client by 65% by conducting comprehensive performance testing.
Reducing memory consumption of multiple apps by up to 50% through code optimization.
Although I specialize in Java, I'm fluent in several programming languages, frameworks, and software. As part of a local initiative, I've been using this knowledge to teach coding to teens at a commumity center.
I look forward to meeting you to discuss the prospect of joining your software development
team. You may contact me by phone at 83282211 or via email, email@first.com or example@email.com to arrange an interview.
Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.
Sincerely,
Rick Schmith
