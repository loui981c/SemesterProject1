Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Senior Software Engineer role at your company.

I am very happy to tell you that your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. A few I would like to highlight that would enable me to contribute to your bottom line are:
Highly skilled in developing and testing software.
Thorough understanding of Angular]S and Nodejs.
