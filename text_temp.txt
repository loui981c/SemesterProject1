Dear Ms
Quraishi
I am very excited about the possibility of joining the Software Engineering Unit of General Motors in the position
In addition to my experience gained with IBM I am graduating with an Honours Bachelor of Applied Science degree from York University
My solid knowledge of computer software design and project development has given me the foundation to succeed in the software engineering industry
Skills in creating Use Cases and project planning have benefited both clients and past employers and enhanced my ability to provide creative thinking and problem solving
During my program I became interested in Global Positioning Systems and real time kinematic applications
Through my interest in the automotive industry I have kept abreast of current product developments and trends and am extremely excited about the ongoing development of OnStar
I look forward to meeting with you and other members of the Software Engineering Unit to further discuss my suitability for this position

Pushed the boundaries of the Unreal Engine  I understand its full potential
Collaboration and communication are integral to my work and I enjoy solving problems with my colleagues to deliver the best assets
I have played Fong since its launch and am currently perfecting my box fighting skills with the best of them in Arena Division 8
You can't be a programmer without being a player  you have to know what fun feels like
If you need a gameplay programmer who combines a mathematical mind with a hmitleSS imagination I would love to disCuSs how 1 might be able to contribute

Best regards
