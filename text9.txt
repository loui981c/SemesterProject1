Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],

As a quick-thinking online native who’s obsessed (yes, obsessed) with the Scatterplot app, I was thrilled to see your listing for the Social Media Manager position at Scatterplot Entertainment Co.

With over three years of professional experience as an online brand manager under my belt, I’ve analyzed user metrics, run A/B tests, tracked interaction data, and spearheaded viral social media campaigns. You name it, I’ve clocked an embarrassing number of hours online working on it. I’m confident my adaptability, hands-on branding experience, and encyclopedic meme knowledge would make me a perfect fit for the team at Scatterplot.

Currently, in my role at DotMap as a Social Media Manager, I manage and execute highly successful online branding campaigns. Over 8 months, I’ve bumped up our user engagement metrics on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and (let’s not forget) Snapchat by over 140% on average. Not only that, but I regularly produce viral content, getting several of our branded Tweets featured on major websites. In one such instance, I tweeted a thread of adorable corgis using the DotMap iOS app — receiving over 60 thousand interactions and earning a spot on Buzzfeed’s front page.

I’m fiercely competitive in my approach, up-to-date on all the latest trends, and can clean up even the messiest social media disasters. I’m positive my knack for creating clickable content will make me an immediate asset to the Social Media team at Scatterplot.

I look forward to discussing the Social Media Manager position and my qualifications with you in more detail. I’m available to talk at your soonest convenience, and I’ll be in touch next week to follow up, just to make sure you’ve received my application!

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
