06/07/2020 Dear Mr. Felsted, 
Programming the locomotion and combat mechanics of Bpex Legends and Story Wars characters for the past three years is the ideal stepping stone for my dream gameplay programmer role at History. People thrive amidst your collaborative and welcoming culture. I played a leading programming role in the industry-acclaimed motion arcs and animation timing of the NME award winning Story Wars Jedi: Rise Up Order game, and my online multiplayer experience with Enough Inc will bring unique insights to the collaboration with your writers and designers. Realism comes when balance and tuning are meticulously scripted. Following on from my MS in Computer Science from UCB, relevant software experience includes UE4, Visual Studio and Perforce as well as fluency in C.+ and eight other programming languages including Python and Java. The following experience would make me a great addition to your Fort9 team: 
• Coded three out of the most popular "living' in the Blame game. • Play tested and debugged over 22,000 lines of code in C.+ in existing games. Pushed the boundaries of the Unreal Engine - I understand its full potential.
Collaboration and communication are integral to my work and I enjoy solving problems with my colleagues to deliver the best assets. I have played Fong since its launch and am currently perfecting my box fighting skills with the best of them in Arena Division 8. You can't be a programmer without being a player - you have to know what fun feels like. If you need a gameplay programmer who combines a mathematical mind with a hmitleSS imagination, I would love to disCuSs how 1 might be able to contribute. 
Best regards. Taylor Cook
